# Results description

This results set is generated by WebAssembly interpreter with OMR jit.
Three tests are disabled, due to lack of opcode support in wasmJIT

* sign_ext.txt : opcode not allowed: i32.extend16_s
* truncation_saturating.txt : opcode not allowed: i32.trunc_sat_f32_s
* multi_value.txt multiple result values not currently supported

The results by AOT compiler should always match the presented results.

The compile_load skip list was enriched for em-interp with
i64_arithmetic
f32_arithmetic
i32_arithmetic
as they have different fails that are understandeable
