# Results description

This results set is generated by WebAssembly interpreter with OMR jit.
Three tests are disabled, due to lack of opcode support in wasmJIT

* sign_ext.txt : opcode not allowed: i32.extend16_s
* truncation_saturating.txt : opcode not allowed: i32.trunc_sat_f32_s
* multi_value.txt multiple result values not currently supported
* call_complex: j2i and i2j are not supported

## Does not compile

* ./test/jit/f32_min_max.txt : Relocation cannot find the symbol
* ./test/jit/f32_min_max.txt :   Relocation cannot find the symbol

## Compile run and load run mismatch
This test needs to be fixed:

test_if_with_result_1() => i32:77919040

## Loaded and golden standard mismatch known issues

These tests have known problems and can be ignored:

* ./test/jit/i64_arithmetic.txt : Formatting output of division by zero, can be ignored

These tests demonstrate issues that need to be resolved

* ./test/jit/load.txt : out of bounds memory access needs to be added
* ./test/jit/i32_arithmetic.txt : error: integer overflow needs to be added
* ./test/jit/ext_load.txt : unsigned load needs to be handled properly
* ./test/jit/wrap_store.txt : out of bounds memory access needs to be added
* ./test/jit/f32_arithmetic.txt : test_f32_copysign_2() => f32:-2.000000 - wrong sign
* ./test/jit/alloca_dropkeep.txt : There's a set of exports that arent executed by the interpreter
* ./test/jit/int_convert.txt : test_i64_extend_u_i32_2() Unsigned extend doesnt work properly
* ./test/jit/store.txt : out of bounds memory access needs to be added
* ./test/jit/truncation.txt :  error: invalid conversion to integer, as well as  error: integer overflow need to be added

The results by AOT compiler should always match the presented results.
